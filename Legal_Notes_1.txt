INTRO
- info is divided into two groups: digital and physical 
- We are focusing on digital data.

WHY INFO SECURITY
- increased digitization (and still increasing)
- This also covers sensitive data
- This is not only voluntary information ( i.e. you must give it, not you choose to give it)

WHY INFO SECURITY (ENTERPRISE)
- employers store sensitive data about their employees 
- Misuse of this can have real life consequences

- 3 dimensions along which security of info can be gained
